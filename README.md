# Vehicle Tracker Prototype

## Project Overview
This project showcases a prototype vehicle tracker developed during my internship at Teltonika IoT & B2B Academy. It is built using an STM32 microcontroller and demonstrates proficiency in low-level programming, including the use of CMSIS and L&L libraries.

### Features
- **Microcontroller Programming:** Utilizes the STM32 microcontroller for the core functionalities.
- **Driver and API Programming:** Includes custom GPIO and UART drivers along with APIs for robust hardware control and efficient data communication.
- **Modem Functionality:** Features an implemented Modem API that supports SMS functionalities and TCP/IP connectivity, enabling remote communication.
- **Multi-threaded Safety:** Incorporates Debug and Memory APIs designed for multi-threaded operation, ensuring system stability and safety.
- **GNSS Integration:** Leverages GNSS technology for precise location tracking, capable of sending coordinates to a server and retrieving location data via SMS.

## Technology Stack
- **Embedded C**: Used for all low-level programming aspects.
- **Low-Level Programming**: In-depth manipulation and control over hardware functions.
- **Additional Skills**: Demonstrates capabilities in system design, debugging, and memory management.

## Project Showcase
This project was developed as part of my internship from February 2024 to April 2024 in Kaunas, Lithuania. It was designed to exhibit my ability to handle complex embedded systems and integrate various technologies for a functional prototype.
